# Write a program to determine your car's gas mileage.

# You should use the input variables "miles_traveled" and "gallons_fuel" and the result
# should be stored in the variable "miles_per_gallon".

# The testing system will place values in each of the input variables, evaluate your code,
# then the result will be checked for correctness.

miles_per_gallon = miles_traveled / gallons_fuel
